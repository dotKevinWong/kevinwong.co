excerpt: Putting together a Homebridge server with Nest and Apple HomePod using a Raspberry Pi 3.

I'm not a huge smart home fan due to privacy concerns but I will consider and allow certain smart home products in our home. When we were renovating our condo, we decided to pickup a Nest Learning Thermostat since American Express was offering a double points deal at the Nest Store and Nest was offering a two-pack of Nest Learning Thermostat's for $450. (Basically, $50 off with double points).

Fast forward a couple months later, Apple finally releases the HomePod. A smart (eh...), Siri-enabled speaker which can act as an Apple HomeKit hub and really great speaker in any home. However, anything tech related has issues. **Google** (_a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Nest_) **doesn't allow nor have HomeKit support with Nest products.** The only real solution was to build your own HomeKit Bridge device and thanks to a few developers, you can easily do that for under $50 using a Raspberry Pi.

I purchased a Raspberry Pi 3, Model B+ with case from adafruit for $40 and a 32GB microSD card on Amazon for $8.

With the hardware in hand, everything was put together and Raspbian Linux was installed. I followed the directions from the Homebridge wiki and all of the plugins I wanted to install.

With the Nest and Samsung TV operating in HomeKit, we can control the thermostat or TV using Siri anywhere around the house or around the world.
